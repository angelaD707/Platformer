## Reflections
### Angela Dong (angelaD707): 
For this project, I have discovered that details are important like whether the block on the map is low enough to jump on or whether the code was correct without any misspelling. Some obstacles I encountered was not Github not committing sometimes cause me to redo what I've already done multiple times.

### Jenna Li (jennaL808): 
In this project, I realized that coding isn't as challenging as I thought. I added the double jump and it was way easier than I thought. Challenges that were challenging to me was the platform not moving as expected. I ended up figuring it out and fixed it.
